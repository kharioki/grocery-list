## tRPC

Is a toolkit that enables us to build totally type safe applications by only using inference. It's a great tool for building APIs and it's very easy to use.

## Prisma ORM

Prisma is an ORM that enables us to write type safe queries to our database. It is a server-side library that helps developers read and write data to the database in an intuitive, efficient and safe way. It is easy to integrate into your framework of choice => Next.js, Graphql, Apollo, nest, Express e.t.c. Prisma simplifies database access, saves repetitive CRUD boilerplate and increases type safety. Its the perfect companion for building production-grade, robust and scalable web applications.

## Zod

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema builder for data validation and parsing. It's a great tool for validating data before it gets to the database. It's very easy to use and it's very fast.

## Prisma Client

Prisma Client is an auto-generated, type-safe query builder generated based on the models and attributes of your Prisma schema.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
